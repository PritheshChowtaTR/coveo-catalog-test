Notable examples are cases arising as a consequence of the COVID-19 lockdown dealing with, among other things, important questions of construction and causation, decisions on insurable interest, the application of s.11 of the Insurance Act 2015, illegality, good faith and exclusion of the 2015 Act’s provisions, the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 2010 and aggregation clauses in liability policies.
